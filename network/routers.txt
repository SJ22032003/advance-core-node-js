Just like switches connect multiple computers in local network, a Router connects multiple switches
with other, basically creating a huge network of computers.

And router is physical connection, which means routers are sending your data through cable and wires,
around the world, from deep in the ocean using underwater optic fiber wires.

When you connect to any WiFi, you are basically connecting yourself to a router.

How you get the internet?
ISP (Internet service provider), they basically help you to connect with router and connect to the internet.
