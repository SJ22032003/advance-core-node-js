1.	Physical Layer ----
	Most low level layer (Physical | Cables), this layer contains the bits/binary for the data.
	This layer doesn't know what type of data is and where its destination is.
	We are just passing the 'Bits' here.

2.	Data Link Layer ----
	In this layer, data is move in 'Frame'. This layer contains switches.
	This layer contains MAC address and the destination.

3.	Network Layer ----
	Network/Internet Layer is shares the data in 'Packets' to the routers.
	With the help of IP address its able to get the destination.
	Data is passed as Packets.
	IP address help to route the traffic to its destination.

4.	Transport Layer ----
	When data is moving in this layer we called it 'Segments'.
	This layer make sure that the packet which you are sending has transport Properly and there are no packet loss (happens lot).
	Packet may get loss and transport layer helps to fix this issue.

5.	Application Layer ----
	Information moving here is called 'Data'.
	This is where we setup our HTTP, SMTP or FTP server.
	We can make sense out the data here and work on it.
	Majority of back-end applications work on this layer.
