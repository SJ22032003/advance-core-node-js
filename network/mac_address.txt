In Old times we had to share data between multiple computers using physical hardware.
Such one we have currently is a Network Card (which now comes embedded in most computers)

MAC Address
The physical network cards comes with unique (always) address we called as MAC address or Media Access Control
And this helps network cards to basically understand which computer it is connected to.
MAC Address is unique 12 byte hexadecimal value.
Also know as hardware address
example ->  a7:10:b4:f2:34:b2

Switch
A switch is basically a physical board where computers can connect to and share data between them.

So my computer (C1) will send data like this to from network card
	source - My MAC Address
	destination - MAC Address of receiver
	data - 01010101.... (data we are sending)

	my computer --> SWITCH --> friend's computer

This goes to the Switch and it will check the destination and route the data accordingly.
