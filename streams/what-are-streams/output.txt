WHAT IS STREAMING?
NODE: AN ABSTRACT INTERFACE TO WORK WITH STREAMS

STREAMING LIKE VIDEO STREAMING NETFLIX | YOUTUBE ?
YES! BUT ITS LOT MORE THAN THAT

STREAMING CAN BE DEFINED AS DATA-FLOWING
GRADUALLY FLOWING OF DATA INSTEAD OF MOVING TO IT ALL AT ONE TIME
IN CHUNKS | ONE BY ONE

BY DEFAULT SIZE OF CHUNCK IS 16kB

TYPES OF STREAMS
1. WRITABLE - ONLY WRITES THE DATA
2. READABLE - ONLY READS THE DATA
3. DUPLEX - DOES BOTH READ AND WRITE (e.g sockets)
4. TRANSFORM - SPECIAL TYPE OF DUPLEX STREAM. YOU CAN MODIFY DATA AS IT FLOWS FROM DESTINATION TO SOURCE (e.g compressing a file. We read a file and "tranform the data into compressed part" and then write to new file)
